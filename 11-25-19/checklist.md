# Coding checklist before approaching problem set

1. Truly understanding the problem

Ask yourself about the scope of the input/output
Read the example inputs and what the expected outputs are.
Formulate some of your own inputs and make sure the intended output is what you expected; this can be done with the Leetcode custom test case feature.
Think of all potential edge cases and how they should be handled (this can also be checked with Leetcode's custom test cases.
Make sure you can describe your approach in English in <3 sentences before you move on to step 2.

2. Devising and your approach

(Optional) Think of and understand the brute force solution.
Does the problem mention a specific runtime or memory constraint? If it does then make sure any solution you think of will meet that constraint.
If the problem does not mention a specific performance constraint, then try to think of what the runtime/space are for the optimal or intended solution.
If you know the optimal solution immediately, then great. You can feel free to start writing pseudocode to draft your solution.
Try to think of all techniques that could be used to meet your performance requirements and how they could be used to solve this problem.
Once you've come up with a solution that you think might work

3. Testing your approach (without code!) on the inputs discussed earlier.

Check if there is any (edge cases / potential bugs) in your solution.
Walk through small input, preferably the ones you brainstormed earlier, to find bugs. This will help the you understand your solution before you start coding it and will also be a sanity check for you that it works.
Write either bullet points or pseudocode to outline the logic of your solution.
If you find your solution does not work, then you will return the previous step and brainstorm a new approach.
